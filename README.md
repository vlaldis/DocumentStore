# DocumentStore

Sample store for documents

Contains:
- store for storing documents in specific format
- update logic
- get in specific format, eg. ```https://localhost:32770/Document/{id}/xml```
- storage abstraction
- document formatting abstraction

TODOs:
- authentication and authorization is to be done, as I'm not yet familiar with it's implementation in Asp.Net core
- SSL ccertificate is only for development, should be substituted by production certificate
- more unit tests (only sample is provided)
